Unfortunately, they do too much and end up full of bugs and hard to maintain.\n\nThe most common GNU Emacs key bindings have a direct counterpart within Atom's core functionality. These can be implemented **without writing any CoffeeScript** and without relying on fragile Atom APIs.\n\n## But ...\n\n... I want a mark, a kill ring, `C-l` to recenter, incremental search, etc.\n\nMost of those features are mutually independent.  They can be implemented as independent Atom packages so that users can pick and choose their favorites.\n",
